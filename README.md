# Is your marketing effective? Let Bayes decide!

Hi there! 👋 Are you curious about whether your marketing efforts are truly paying off? In this workshop, we’ll explore why Marketing Media Models (MMM) are essential and how you can build an effective one using Bayes, Python, and PyMC. By the end, you’ll have the tools to make data-driven decisions that truly work.

The easiest way to dive in is by exploring the notebooks on Google Colab. Let’s get started!
